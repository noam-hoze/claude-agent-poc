# Claude Code Workflow
#
# This workflow integrates Claude AI into GitHub to automatically handle issues and PRs.
#
# Two main features:
# 1. Interactive Mode: Responds to @claude mentions in issues, PRs, and comments
# 2. Auto-solve Mode: Automatically implements issues labeled with "auto-solve"
#
# Prerequisites:
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret must be configured in repository settings
# - "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" must be enabled
#   (Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions)

  # INTERACTIVE MODE: Responds to @claude mentions
  # ============================================================================
  # This job runs when:
  # - Someone mentions @claude in an issue comment, PR comment, or review
  # - A new issue is opened with @claude mentioned in the description
  # - An issue is assigned to the claude-bot user
  #
  # Claude will respond to the mention and can help with code review,
  # bug investigation, feature implementation, and general coding questions.

            Read issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} and implement a complete solution with working code.

            REQUIREMENTS:
            1. Create or modify the requested files with working, tested code
            2. Commit your changes: git add . && git commit -m "Clear descriptive message"
            3. Push to the current branch: git push origin HEAD

            The workflow will automatically create a pull request after you push.
            VERIFY each step completes successfully before moving to the next.
