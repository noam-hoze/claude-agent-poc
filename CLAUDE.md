# Project Context for Claude

## Project Overview
This is a QA Productivity Dashboard project that provides queryable insights and daily briefs.

## Purpose
Chat-first dashboard for tracking QA metrics, team productivity, and providing actionable insights.

## Coding Standards

### General Principles
- Write clear, maintainable code
- Follow existing code patterns in the repository
- Include comments for complex logic
- Write tests for new features

### Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces based on file type)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Avoid deeply nested code

### Git Workflow
- Create feature branches from main
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Reference issue numbers in commits when applicable
- Keep PRs focused on single features or fixes
